<h4><u>INTRODUCTION  </u></h4>
<p>

Transferring large files to removable media can often be a nightmare due to size restrictions and security concerns. We've all faced the frustration of large files not fitting on our devices. Enter Data Ninja, a Java-based tool designed to address these issues head-on.</p>
<p>
Data Ninja seamlessly splits your files into manageable fragments, each protected by robust encryption. This means no more struggling with error messages or insecure transfers. It offers multiple functionalities:</p>

<li>Efficient File Splitting: Automatically adapts to different storage capacities.</li>

<li> Robust Encryption: Ensures your data is safe from unauthorized access.</li>
<li>Seamless Merging: Easily recombine the fragments on your destination machine.</li><br>
<p>
Data Ninja saves time, reduces frustration, and most importantly, secures your data. It's the perfect tool for students, professionals, and anyone who needs to share large files securely and conveniently.</p>
<p>
I encourage you to explore Data Ninja further and experience the power of secure, efficient file distribution.</p>

<h4> Applications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>  File Sharing with Size Restrictions: As you mentioned, email services like Gmail often have file size limits. Data Ninja allows you to split large files into smaller chunks that can be uploaded within these restrictions. The recipient can then join the parts back together to get the original file. </li>

<li>Data Backups: When backing up data to external drives or online storage, splitting large files can be useful for managing storage space and transfer times. Data Ninja can help you efficiently back up large files by splitting them into manageable pieces. </li>
<li>Large File Transfers: Transferring very large files over a network can be slow and error-prone. Splitting the file with Data Ninja can improve transfer speeds and reduce the risk of errors during transmission.</li>
<li> Encrypt your splitted data</li>
<li> Maintain Data Integrity</li>
<li> Prevent from stealing your data </li>

</ul>
<h4><u>Technology used </u></h4>
<ul>
  The Logical or Virtual equipment of a system is called Software and the following equipment required for our project so that our project run efficiently: 
  <li>Platform :Window7/10/11 </li>
  <li> DOS / Linux/ Mac OS </li>
  <li> Java Editor : Notepad / Visual studio</li>
  <li> Compiler: Java Development Kit (JDK 1.7 or above) is the compiler that will be used to develop this 
        application   </li>
</ul>


<h5><u> Proposed system</u></h5>
 <p>In the proposed system, splitting of file will be for all types of files like text, document, image, 
audio, video, pdf, etc. The advantage of splitting the file is that, we can upload or download the spitted 
file easily, when there is a restriction in size of the file to be
uploaded or downloaded. </p>

<h5><u>Overall description </u> </h5>
 <p> By using our tool Data Ninja one can easily split the file into smaller segments, which in turn can 
be joined to retrieve the original file. Will have three modules one for segmentation, other for spitted the 
file into segments and other for joining the spitted parts to obtain the original file. In the segmentation we 
need to decide the how many segments we need to have for a file, and will have split and join option, 
using split we can divide the file into required segments and than can join the segments to obtain the 
original file.  </p>


<h5><u>PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT </u></h5> 

<li> OBJECTIVE: </li>
<ul>
 <li><b>Security Objectives </b>are the main concerns for any data and organization regarding their any types 
of data either they are audio, video, text and other format. So targets the customer establishes for 
their security program of any types of information. </li>
<li> Without security objectives, they do not know what they are trying to accomplish for security 
regarding this project and therefore will not reach any goals. </li>
<li>The main Objectives are also the portability of splitter files easily that no end user can guess the 
format of the file too and may leak the information. One of those areas requiring the customer's 
involvement, and so the assessment team cannot make up the information.</li> 
</ul>

<li> Features of our project (Advantages)</li>
<ul>
<li> Our project assists to the users in splitting the larger files into smaller splitted files, which can
easily be uploaded or downloaded.</li> 
  <li> Encryption</li>
<li> Our project or tool is more user friendly, and can be used easily for file splitting and joining and 
our tool can be used for splitting of video files, audio files, files which may not available in 
existing system.</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul>
