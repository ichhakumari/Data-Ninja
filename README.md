<h4><u>INTRODUCTION  </u></h4>
<p>Data Ninja basically used to split the large files which are not possible to upload or download, when we 
have to file size restrictions imposed by the application. For example, if we need to upload a file say 30 
MB using Gmail, than it might not be possible as Gmail restrict the file size less than 30MB, so if we use 
our tool we can split the file and send the splitted parts by uploading it and can retain the original file by 
joining the splitted parts Likewise we can use our application in other fields as well; where we need the 
file (can be audio, video, text, etc). Using our tool, which is a windows application, one need to decide 
size for each segment, than need to split the original file. On joining he/she need to select the first and 
should click on join to get the original file </p>

<h4><u>Technology used </u></h4>
<ul>
  The Logical or Virtual equipment of a system is called Software and the following equipment required for our project so that our project run efficiently: 
  <li>Platform :Window7/10/11 </li>
  <li> DOS / Linux/ Mac OS </li>
  <li> Java Editor : Notepad / Visual studio</li>
  <li> Compiler: Java Development Kit (JDK 1.7 or above) is the compiler that will be used to develop this 
        application   </li>
</ul>


<h5><u> Proposed system</u></h5>
 <p>In the proposed system, splitting of file will be for all types of files like text, document, image, 
audio, video, pdf, etc. The advantage of splitting the file is that, we can upload or download the spitted 
file easily, when there is a restriction in size of the file to be
uploaded or downloaded. </p>

<h5><u>Overall description </u> </h5>
 <p> By using our tool Data Ninja one can easily split the file into smaller segments, which in turn can 
be joined to retrieve the original file. Will have three modules one for segmentation, other for spitted the 
file into segments and other for joining the spitted parts to obtain the original file. In the segmentation we 
need to decide the how many segments we need to have for a file, and will have split and join option, 
using split we can divide the file into required segments and than can join the segments to obtain the 
original file.  </p>


<h5><u>PROBLEM DEFINITION AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT </u></h5> 
<ol>
 <li>Purpose </li>

  
 The purpose of developing our tool is to splits the larger files which can't be uploaded or 
downloaded using some application like Gmail, yahoo mail, etc as per file size restrictions 
imposed by this application. In order to support larger file uploads and downloads we will use our 
tool, using which one can easily upload or download splitted files. 


<li> Scope</li>

We can use our application or tool to split the files types such as audio, video, text,
etc. so that splitted files can be uploaded or downloaded easily.

<li> Goals:</li>
The main aim of the project is to design software for splitting of any type of files into segments and 
reassembling them. The project provides compression of file before splitting and compressed file is 
used for splitting. In already existing software they provide only some file types. We design software 
to split all types of files like text, document, image, audio, video, pdf etc. The files splitted portion 
will be in non-readable format and parts can be joined back to get the original file. 

<li> OBJECTIVE: </li>
<ul>
 <li><b>Security Objectives </b>are the main concerns for any data and organization regarding their any types 
of data either they are audio, video, text and other format. So targets the customer establishes for 
their security program of any types of information. </li>
<li> Without security objectives, they do not know what they are trying to accomplish for security 
regarding this project and therefore will not reach any goals. </li>
<li>The main Objectives are also the portability of splitter files easily that no end user can guess the 
format of the file too and may leak the information. One of those areas requiring the customer's 
involvement, and so the assessment team cannot make up the information.</li> 
</ul>

<li> Features of our project (Advantages)</li>
<ul>
<li> Our project assists to the users in splitting the larger files into smaller splitted files, which can
easily be uploaded or downloaded.</li> 
  <li> Encryption</li>
<li> Our project or tool is more user friendly, and can be used easily for file splitting and joining and 
our tool can be used for splitting of video files, audio files, files which may not available in 
existing system.</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul>
</ol>
